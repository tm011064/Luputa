Description: The CommonTools.Web.Navigation.UrlRewriteModule is a module that can be used for easy url rewriting controlled via rules defined at
a web.sitemap file. 

Example: using the Sample.Web.config and Sample.Web.Sitemap files provided at this folder, a user can access the web page
"{ myDomain }/Javascript/Default.aspx?Category=10" via "{ myDomain }/Javascript/10/Default.aspx", which is a far more friendly url than the one
with a querystring.
